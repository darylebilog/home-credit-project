Our Home Credit Loan Default Prediction project addresses the challenge of accurately predicting the risk of loan default for clients with limited or no credit history. This critical problem directly influences loan approval decisions and portfolio performance, making it crucial for Home Credit to identify potential defaulters and make informed loan decisions accordingly. The success of our project will be measured by the model's predictive accuracy and ability to distinguish high-risk clients. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is either default or non-default. To achieve our goals, we plan to evaluate the model using different kinds of machine learning models.

The project comprises several key stages: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model testing and development, and performance validation. As a collaborative team of four MSBA students, we aim to deliver an efficient predictive model within the next month. Our key milestones include data cleaning, creating an exploratory data analysis, testing the model, and presenting the project with accurate outcomes.

During the exploratory data analysis, we encountered numerous columns with missing values. To streamline our analysis and improve efficiency, we decided to impute the data of these columns by replacing 'XNA' with 'None', thereby avoiding the need to handle missing values.

As part of the team, I created a visualization highlighting the Top 10 positive and negative correlations with the TARGET variable. This analysis aims to identify the most relevant variables influencing the target variable. This visualization can be found in the EDA sections 4.4 and 4.5. Additionally, we created a heatmap displaying the correlations between each variable, as shown in section 4.6. I also developed the Naive Bayes model for our team, though we concluded that this model might not be the most suitable for this particular analysis.

The value of this project lies in Home Credit's ability to accurately assess individuals with little to no credit history, expanding their services to a broader market underserved by the traditional banking system. By correctly identifying deserving applicants, Home Credit can make more informed decisions and mitigate loan default risks.

At the project's conclusion, we identified the ideal candidate for Home Credit as someone who is married, has a higher education, has a job, owns a car, and possesses a house or an apartment. We recommend that the company prioritize these variables when evaluating loan applications to increase the likelihood of successful approvals.

Throughout the project, our team faced challenges working on our respective parts and seamlessly merging our codes. Effective communication and understanding each other's code were crucial to overcoming these obstacles.

As a valuable learning experience, this project emphasized the importance of thoroughly exploring the provided data. While code implementation is essential, effective data analysis and reporting play a vital role in conveying meaningful insights. Supporting findings with a well-explained analysis is imperative to present a comprehensive and understandable report.
